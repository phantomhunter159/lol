Profile</p>

<p class=Text>Deciding a team name is crucial as I want a name that can
represent the dynamic of teamwork in the team, while also grabbing the
attention of others. Because of this, I would like to name my team as Team
Ghidorah.</p>

<p class=Text>In a group consists of 4 people, I would first like to work with
individuals that can step up and take the role of guiding the team as a leader.
As an introverted person, I don’t have the necessary leadership skills to give
out efficient instructions as well as managing everyone progress since I tend
to work better alone and concentrate on doing thing at my own paces. In
additions, my decisions making sometime can be heavily influence by my emotions
and would lead to undesirable outcomes. Due to that reason, having a leader
early on can benefits the team as the leader would communicate effectively with
team members, keep track of important deadlines and make the hard choice on the
behalf of the team to achieve the greatest results. Secondly, I would like to work
with people who are flexible in dealing with challenges and sharing their ideas
regularly. Being an observant and prospecting person, I focus on listening
carefully to other opinions before voicing out ideas of my own and facing
problems with many ways of approach. For this reason, having people who
willingly share their ideas and prepare for challenges would not only helps
team member to collaborate actively with each other’s but also allow the team
to capitalize on new opportunity when dealing with challenges. Lastly, I would
like to work with people who have strict habit that committed to improving
themselves. These type of individuals are perfectionist that aim to be the best
and as such, having them in the team would both motivate and encourage other
members in the team to push on with all their efforts.</p>

<p class=Text style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Project
Ideas</p>

<p class=Text>Due to the ongoing pandemic happening in Vietnam, the people are
instructed to stay inside of their home and avoid direct contact with other
people until further notice. This resulted in the increase of people demands
for daily good as they are restricted from entering crowded places such as
supermarket or convenient stores. Moreover, delivery people or door-to-door distributors
are also limited on how many time they can go out and deliver the goods to
people in need. Hence, the project is aiming to develop and provide a grocery
pick-up robot for the sake of counter the act of going outside during the COVID
pandemic lockdown. </p>

<p class=Text>The idea for this project first come to mind after being stuck
inside of my own house for multiple months without the access to the usual
items I use every day due to the official instruction the government
broadcasted across the country that restrict people from going outside to
restock. As time go on, COVID cases in Vietnam escalate more and even reaching
over 200 000 cases in August of 2021 according to the Ministry of Public Health
of Vietnam<sup> <b>[1]</b></sup>. Because of this, it motivates me to find an
alternative to restock on goods without personally going outside through the
utilization of Raspberry Pi and Robot as it proves to be inexpensive and a practical
solution in solving the problem.</p>

<p class=Text>Currently, the entirety of Vietnam is heavily under lockdown due
to the dangerous COVID pandemic especially in Ho Chi Minh city where both the
people and government are affected the most with the number of COVID cases
reaching up to nearly 50% of total cases <b><sup>[1]</sup></b>. As a result of
staying inside for too long without daily needs being fulfilled, some of the
people decided to go out of their home and went to crowded places to satisfied
their needs despite the strict instructions given by the government. To address
the problem of people constantly going outside, the government created an order
where only people granted with a permit would be allow to go out and those who
don’t have a permit would be fined and force to go back to their home. In
additions, the government even set curfew time and limit the amount of time
delivery system can be used since coming in contact with delivery people would
likely to increase the chance of spreading the virus. Thus, I came up with the
idea to solve this problem by developing a robot and sending it out to pick up
grocery instead of sending out human. The Pick Up Grocery Robot or P.U.G for
short is robotic machine which serve the purpose of going out to the designated
location assigned by the user so that the robot can gather all the required
grocery and deliver them back to the user location. The robot is monitor and
can be remotely control from far away by the user through an app utilizing the
operating system embedded in the Raspberry Pi. The outer appearance of the
robot resembles similarly to a shopping cart with metallic exterior, 4 legs
with each having a wheel to move around, two small speakers attach to each side
of the robot, a small microphone stick to the side of one of the speaker, a camera
hook up to the front of the robot and the battery supply at the end. Whereas,
the inner appearance of the robot consists of the Raspberry Pi where the outer
equipment is connected to and many of the circuits that run through the robot. The
robot work by first receiving a command from the user to travel to the location
that the user has appointed to. During it journey to the location, the robot
would use it front camera to sense it surrounding environment and track down
the quickest way to the location while also avoiding any obstacles that might
damage or stop it from proceeding the journey. Upon it arrival, the robot would
engage with the seller (to grab their attention) where the user could then
communicate and project their voice through the speakers. From here, the seller
can also communicate with the user and ask what they would need by using the
included mic that stick to one of the speaker which can be pull out so that it
can be use more easily. After acquiring the needed goods and paying the seller
through credit card transaction, the robot would use the same route to go back
to the user location. One of the many benefits from using the robot would be
that it is safer for the user as they can comfortably stay inside of their own
home and won’t have to go outside during the pandemic. Additionally, this
proves to be way more convenience and can be used for a very long time
throughout the pandemic. However, the drawbacks would be that the connection
limit where the maximum distance the robot can go is only 5-6 kilometers and
there is no guarantee that the robot can recover itself if there was an
accident that cause damage to the robot or if there are people who want to
steal the robot entirely. Even so, the robot is created with the intention to
help Ho Chi Minh City ‘s resident under the pandemic lockdown to restock on
goods without having to leave their home.  </p>

<p class=Text>In order to develop the robot, the equipment needed for the
project would be a Raspberry Pi 4 (prefer to be a 4GB model or even better with
8GB model) running the Raspberry Pi OS install on the board that support
programming languages such as C/C++, Python 2/3 or Scratch and a battery source
to supply the robot with power. Additionally, the robot would need an
attachable camera like the Raspberry Pi Camera to detect the surrounding and make
sure to travel correctly to the designated location as well as having a small microphone
and speakers so there can be an effective communication between the buyer and
seller. Furthermore, the robot would require to have a container resembles similarly
to that of a shopping basket with wheel for the purpose of storing the goods. </p>

<p class=Text>For the project to become a reality, it would first require to
have coding skills ranging in multiple programming languages (where Python is
most prefer) with the level of experience extending from intermediate to
advanced level. Secondly, I would need to obtain building skills in order to
not only construct the robot with the help of constructing software such as
Solid Work but also ways to maintain the robot for a long duration. Lastly, I
would need to acquire marketing skills to be able to push the project into the
media eyes and grab the attention of sponsors. Beside from the hardware and
software, which can be easy to obtain, the skills listed would be more
difficult to find as I would need to either find people that meet these
requirements or develop those skills myself through intense studies.</p>

<p class=Text>In consideration that the project has a chance to be successful, the
desirable outcome I want to achieved from the project would be providing a safe
and secure delivery system entirely by pick up robots to the citizens of
Vietnam, especially in major cities such as Ho Chi Minh. By sending out robots
instead of humans, the project would help to reduce the growing amount of cases
where people are spreading the virus through direct contact while allowing the
government to monitor the people more easily. Likewise, this project would also
open the door to new opportunities in the developments of robot being used for
other fields in the distant future. </p>

<p class=Text style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in'>4.<span

Technologies (Robots + Raspberry Pi)</p>

<p class=Text>My project idea utilizes the function of a Raspberry Pi to build
a grocery pick up robot so the project would revolve around the technological
area of Robotics and the small computing device known as the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry
Pi is a low cost and mini sized computer capable of helping people from all
ages ranging from curious youngsters to old adults to engage in using computers
and helps them learn how to program in various programming languages like
Python or Scratch. There are multiple models available for the Raspberry Pi,
with the most recent model being the Raspberry Pi 4 completely upgraded with
more features like a more powerful processor, extra RAM choices and a lot more
useful ports. On the other hand, robots are described as any man-made machine
that built for the purpose of replicating specific actions to perform work
either by remote control under human influences or automatically by itself. <b><sup>[2]</sup></b><sup>
</sup>Robot don’t have identical models since each would serve a different
purpose for different reason but they are composed into 3 main part of the
Controller (which processes the information given to the robot from a computer
program), the Mechanical (which consists majority of the robot parts that helps
with its movement and function) and the Sensor (which helps the robot identify
its surrounding). Both the Raspberry Pi and robot are state of the art in the
technology world with the Raspberry Pi first developed it prototype back in
2006 and the first company to formed using robot was in 1956 <b><sup>[2]</sup></b>.
Currently, the Raspberry Pi offer it users with the ability to interact with
the outside world just by plugging it into any monitor along with using the
standard keyboard/mouse setting to come up with ideas and develop their own
personal projects. For instance, the Raspberry Pi can help to design a network
monitoring tool where it allows you to monitor your important network data or help
to make a portable streaming device where you can easily access to watching
shows. Whereas, robots in the modern world are being used mostly in industries
as robot helps business to increase in productivity and able to work in an
environment that is consider hazardous for regular human being. For example,
robot working in automobile manufacture are able to carried out repetitive
tasks in large quantity without complaining. In the next 3 years, the improvement
of the Raspberry Pi from the release of newer model would allow to unlock even
more potential for the active community to discover and encourage to develop
more incredible projects on the tiny but powerful board. Similarly, the
improvement of robot in the next 3 years would allow robots to diverse
themselves in other working areas as it is predicted that they are being mass
produced by major companies in 2021 and will be taking over half of the work
tasks from around the globe in 2025 <b><sup>[3]</sup></b> which can be a good
thing as it lead to the establishment of a new market for increasing demands in
new jobs. Other implementation of technological developments such as cloud
computing with Raspberry Pi and especially artificial intelligence in robot
play a key role in making these expectations to be possible. For Raspberry Pi,
the integration of cloud computing allows users to host their own remote
servers and stored their data more securely. For robots, according to Industry
Week <b><sup>[4]</sup>, </b>the integration of AI would benefit robot to feel
more alive as existing robot home assistant like Echo and Google Home would be
provided with more useful resources to improve and deepen the relationship
between users and devices. </p>

<p class=Text>While the development of the Raspberry Pi proves to only bring in
positive impacts as the advancement of the small computing devices would sparks
new innovation to emerge, the development of robots acknowledges the fact that
the world would surely experience the potential of both positive and negative
impacts. For the negative impacts, robots are likely to cause changes in work
force due to around a third of the world’s work tasks were already being
handled by machines and now is causing a shift in the balance where it is
expected that over half of all low-skilled jobs such as farmers or front desk receptionists
would be at risk of being taken over by robots <b><sup>[3]</sup></b>. Furthermore,
the inclusion of robots might also impact the human capabilities and
interaction where it causes us to be less capable in doing common tasks, taking
away our abilities to think for ourselves and isolating us to be lonelier
overtime. However, there is still light at the end of tunnel as robots provide
as many jobs as they take where there would still be opportunities for brand new
jobs to be discovered or already existing jobs such as coding and engineering
related jobs would get a boost to promote the needs for more workers. Even
though majority of the work force being affected the most by the replacement of
robots are people from the working class as well as the less educated people,
there is still hopes of assisting them by providing with proper education
accompany with additional training to enable them to adapt with new given jobs.</p>

<p class=Text>In my daily life, the existence of robots alongside with the
Raspberry Pi being commonly used everywhere would affect me physically and
mentally but in a good way. Physically, the robot would create a safer
environment to be around since all the dangerous would be handled by them,
allows me to relax and take care of myself better. Mentally, by having all of
the menial tasks like housework and noting down important details to be monitor
by using the Raspberry Pi, this allows me to be more comfortable and be more productive
more other works. All of this would be different for me to adapt to but like
all technology, I can easily get used to it after sometime with it. This would
also affect my family greatly where the implementation of the Raspberry Pi
would help my grandma to get into using computers and the assistance would help
my mom organize housework better. Moreover, this would also benefit many of my
friends who are interested in technology to get robots and utilize them in
their own household. </p>

<p class=Text>After discussing and presenting my project idea about the robot
that can helped with picking up grocery during the pandemic, I managed to
receive feedbacks from two of my classmates which is from a student named Phat
and a student named Hoang. Phat feedbacks said that my project idea have the
potential to grow as the idea can be use in different corner of the country
where the same problem is occurring and the idea can be useful to provide a
helping hand to people around the world. Whereas, feedbacks from Hoang seem to
disagree with the concept, Hoang said that the idea is too unrealistic as it
proves to be not effective since the range of delivery is limited and there
won’t be enough robot to provide for anyone around in Ho Chi Minh, much less to
people around the globe. Not only so, Hoang also said that the idea would not
be future proof as after the pandemic end, majority of the robot would not put
into use since everything would be back to normal and people wouldn’t use them
anymore. From here, I understand how useful these feedbacks are due to it
exposing the both the good and bad things that lied deep within my project idea
and I fully agree with Phat and Hoang feedbacks. Yes, my project idea does have
potential for growth but I would need to cover holes that might lead the
project to failure. For future improvement, I would use feedbacks from Phat to
continue with the things that can bring in benefits while using feedbacks from
Hoang as guide to avoid common mistake and to look beyond what happening in the
present and toward the future. </p>
